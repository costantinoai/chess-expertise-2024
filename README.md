# chess-expertise-2024

This repository contains scripts and helper modules used in the Chess Expertise study.

The analysis is now divided into two submodules:

- **chess-glm** – MATLAB utilities and helper scripts for first and second level GLM analysis.
- **chess-mvpa** – MVPA and RSA analysis code along with general plotting utilities.
- **common** – shared helper functions and unified plotting style used across modules.

Additional behavioural and dataset visualisation scripts can be found in their respective folders.
